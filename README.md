# MIT-Race-Car
A workshop named "Machine Learning and Autonomous Vehicle" held on campus of MIT.

Professor: Tze-Ping Low, Li Ding and Tom Bertalan

During the workshop, I was
+ Being immersed in the cutting-edge research environment of MIT to learn firsthand about the developments of the applications of machine learning in autonomous driving technologies
+ Carried out entry level research on autonomous vehicles and Robotics
+ Worked in group to assemble, program and test small scale self-driving vehicles based on Raspberry Pi, ROS and Python
+ Used the PID controller for steering adjustment to accomplish lane following
+ Built both SVM and CNN classifiers by Scikit-learn and TensorFlow to accomplish traffic sign recognition
+ Worked as the team leader and win the 2nd prize on the match day


Main coding files are included in `MIT-Race-Car/main/src/`.
